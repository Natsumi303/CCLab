                    they appear as floating, expressive faces, each with a distinct color tied to their emotional state. 
                    While Fizzy is known for its transformation from yellow happiness to red anger, 
                    others in its family show different emotional changes. Some may turn blue when sad, 
                    while others turn green when envious, etc. Besides, all Gyras have the ability to influence their environment to express their emotions, 
                    Fizzy is known to rotate objects as a response to emotional shifts.

                Fizzy is a small creature discovered in a vibrant garden at Hong Kong Disneyland. 
                It resembles a yellow happy face that lives in a room. 
                When calm and happy, it remains yellow and helps keep the room organized. However, 
                if not fed, Fizzy gets angry, turning red. In this state,
                it moves faster and can rotate objects. Feeding Fizzy with a burger restores its calm state, 
                and it resumes helping to organize the space.
